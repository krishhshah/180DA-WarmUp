This warmup consists of three files.
fr.py is the substitute I have done to replace Task 4.

fr.py is a script that uses the OpenCV and Face_Recognition Python packages in order to do facial recognition and facial tracking. It also uses pyttsx3 in order to dictate the found person's face in a verbal manner using the computer's connected and/or built-in speaker.

Below are some images indicating the uses and results of this script.

This is the video feed result using OpenCV that places a rectangle around the face found and the name of the person with its confidence percentage.

This is the Terminal output that tells us where the face is on the screen with the x-midpoint of the face.
