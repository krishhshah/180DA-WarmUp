## GUI in Project

For the basketball game, I believe we could use a gui to dictate whether there is a powerup for consistent basketball streaks. We can also use the gui to show whether the basketball went in or not.

For the bomb game, I believe we can use the gui to show defusing or not. We can also use it to give each player certain tasks that require visual thinking.
